# HYG Blockchain Solution

Welcome to the repository for HYG Blockchain Solution, a cutting-edge component of the Software Development Platform (SDP) that addresses global challenges in blockchain performance, concurrency, and latency.

## Introduction

HYG Blockchain is an independently designed technology that stands as a benchmark against established frameworks like Hyperledger Fabric. It is engineered to tackle the most demanding blockchain applications with high throughput, low latency, and enhanced concurrency features.

## Key Features

- **High Performance**: Tailored to meet the requirements of high-transaction environments.
- **Enhanced Concurrency**: Innovative algorithms that facilitate simultaneous transactions, reducing bottlenecks and increasing efficiency.
- **Low Latency**: Optimized network protocols and consensus mechanisms to ensure quick transaction validations and commit times.

## Technology Comparison

HYG Blockchain sets a new standard in the field by benchmarking its performance and concurrency against Hyperledger Fabric, one of the leading blockchain platforms. Our solution excels in scenarios where traditional blockchain systems struggle, particularly in high-load and real-time transaction processing.

For a detailed comparison and benchmarks, please refer to the [SDP project overview](https://github.com/fangwen7171613/sdp.git).

## Development and Building

The HYG Blockchain solution is built using a modular approach, allowing for easy integration and scalability. Follow the development guidelines provided in the SDP project to get started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fangwen7171613/sdp.git
